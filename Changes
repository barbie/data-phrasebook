        - More POD to explain Classes and Dictionaries.
        - file & dictionary reloading.

0.20    03 Mar 2005
        - POD updates.

0.19    02 Mar 2005
        - Removed Test::MockObject from tests. No longer needed.

0.18    01 Mar 2005
        - Name change from Phrasebook to Data::Phrasebook.
        - Loader now uses Module::Pluggable due to ease of use and the fact
          that Class::MethodMaker now regularly fails on Win32.
        - Removed Class::WhiteHole.
        - Major documentation overhaul.

0.17    09 Feb 2004
        - New maintainer - Barbie - as of 31 Jan 2003.
        - Default loader, YAML, now a separate distribution.
        - Default loader is now plain text. This was done to minimise the
          required modules, and to enable the appropriate datastore for
          loading to be install separately.
        - dictionary/section setting now implemented as:
          Phrasebook->new( dict => 'NEW' );

        - Query refactored a bit.
        - Documentation fixed regarded some implementations.
