0.18    01 Mar 2005
        - Name change from Phrasebook to Data::Phrasebook.

        - Major documentation overhaul.

        - Default loader, YAML, now a separate distribution.
        - Default loader is now plain text. This was done to minimise the
          required modules, and to enable the appropriate datastore for
          loading to be install separately.
        - dictionary/section setting now implemented as:
          Phrasebook->new( dict => 'NEW' );
